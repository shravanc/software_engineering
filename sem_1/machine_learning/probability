Probability:
Probability of a variable x is denoted as p(x=X): the probability of variable x being in state X.

Domain:
dom(x) denotes the states x can take. Example: dom(coin) = {heads, tails}

Distribution:
Given a variable, x, its domain dom(x) and a full specification of the probability values for each of the variables states, p(x), we have a distribution for x.
->this is basically all possible outcomes for all possible inputs. The one in the table above is nothing but the distribution of the emails. It is the understanding of the state of the particular problem at our hand. Depending on that state our next prediction depends or the occurance depends.

Normalization:
The summation of the probability over all the states is 1.
-> this is the rule for the probability. Probability always be within 0 to 1 i.e 0<p(x)<1. It cannot be voilated. if p(x)=0 then particular outcome is not going to occur for sure. If p(x)=1 then it is very sure the outcome will occur.
Xdom(x)p(x=X) = 1


Example for all the above:
Fair Dice:
 - x denotes the outcome of the dice
 - dom(x) = {1,2,3,4,5}
 - p(x=1) = p(x=2) =.......= p(x=6) = 1/6
 - Normalisation = p(x=1) + p(x=2) + ... + p(x=6) = 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 6/6 = 1


Probability Mass Function(PMF):
A PMF is the list of all probabilities p(x=X) for each element x of dom(x).
-> PMF is a probability measure that gives us probabilities of the possible values for a random variable. 

Elementary set Theory and Boolean Logic formulas to remeber:


Conditional probability:


Two Variables:
2 Fair Dice:
 - z denotes the outcoume of the two dice 
 - dom(x) = {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3),....,(6,6)}
 - p(z=(1,1)) = p(z=(1,2)) = ... = p(z=(6,6)) = 1/36
 - Normalization = p(z=(1,1)) + p(z=(1,2)) + ... + p(z=(6,6)) = 1
